The chatbot built above is made using Recurrent Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing. This chatbot works only on Tensorflow 1.0.0. Firstly, in the chatbot we perfrom Data pre-processing with help of the given dataset. In the data preprocessing step we first create a dictoanry to map each line to its respective ID. Then we create a list of all the conversations and seperate out all the questions and answers. Next, we clean the questions and answers so that it will be easier during cleaning for example I'm will be changed to I am and so on. We later on remove the words in which the occurences is less than 5% this is done a by having a certain threshold value. Then we add tokens to the dictonaries.The next step is building the Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) model. Sequence to Sequence models are, models which are mainly used in tasks such as translation. In the RNN we use a concept called as LSTM(Long Short Term Memory), it can not only process single data points but it can also process sequences of data. We create an encoding and decoding layer in this type of model.
